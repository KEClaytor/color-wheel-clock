# Interactive NeoPixel Color Wheel "Clock"

This project started out as an LED clock for my kid, but quickly evolved into just a cool interactive light-show that they could enjoy (know your audience - the clock function was not a killer feature).

In addition to the twelve RGB LEDs, the three buttons allow for eight modes of operation and the “soft-pot” touch potentiometer allows for continuous selection, and selections that can be mapped to the clock face.
